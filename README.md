# [**Traffic Signs Classification**]

**Objective and Problem Statement**
- Traffic Signs Classification is an important task for self driving cars. In this Project, I have prepared a Deep Convolutional Neural Network Model which can classify the images of 43 distinct types of Traffic Signals. It is a multi-class Classification Project. You can gain insights about the Impelementation of Deep Convolutional Neural Network in Image Classification.

**Convolutional Neural Network**
- In deep learning, a convolutional neural network is a class of deep neural networks, most commonly applied to analyzing visual imagery. They are also known as shift invariant or space invariant artificial neural networks, based on their shared-weights architecture and translation invariance characteristics.

**Getting the Data**
- I have manually downloaded the Data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). You can download the [Data](https://github.com/ThinamXx/TrafficSigns..Classification/blob/master/TrafficSign%20Data.rar) from [here](https://github.com/ThinamXx/TrafficSigns..Classification/blob/master/TrafficSign%20Data.rar).
